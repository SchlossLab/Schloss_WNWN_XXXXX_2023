# Re-evaluating *Waste not, want not...*

This is a reanalaysis of McMurdie and Holmes's 2014 manuscript, ["Waste Not, Want Not: Why Rarefying Microbiome Data Is 
Inadmissible"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003531) published in PLOS Computational Biology. The code, primarily
R markdown documents, is contained in the directory downloaded from the journal's website as
[Protocol S1](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003531.s001).
